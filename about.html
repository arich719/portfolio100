    <h3>ABUT ME </h3>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Anthony Richardson, a Colorado native with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Graduating with a BA in Society, Ethics, & Human Behavior from the University of Washington, I've always been drawn to understanding the impact of technology on our lives.</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, you'll often find me pedaling through the scenic routes of Seattle or capturing moments with my camera. Embracing my inner nerd, I firmly believe that with dedication, anything is achievable.</p>
<p>My programming journey is just unfolding, and I'm currently honing my skills as a Front End Developer in Training in the vibrant tech hub of Seattle. Over the next nine months, I'm immersed in a rigorous certificate program at the University of Washington Continuing Education School. Looking ahead, I'm excited to delve into the realm of full-stack JavaScript, with ambitions to carve a path as a proficient JavaScript Developer.</p>
<p>Join me on this exhilarating journey as I transform my passion for technology into impactful solutions and memorable experiences.</p>
